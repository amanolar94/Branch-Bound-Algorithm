# [Branch-Bound-Algorithm](https://aristosman94.pythonanywhere.com/BranchandBound)
Branch and Bound is an algorithm for solving discrete optimization problems. The algorithm is implemented in python.
The libraries [Pulp](https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/) (for solving the LPs in every step) and
[Treelib](http://treelib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (for the implementation of tree data structure) are used.
I also have used the web framework [Web2Py](http://www.web2py.com/) for creating a web app and [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/orgchart) for visualizing my results.
